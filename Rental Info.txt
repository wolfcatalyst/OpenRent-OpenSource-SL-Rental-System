Customizing Your Space:

Parcel Division: If you're interested in dividing your parcel into smaller sections, let me know, and we can discuss the possibilities.
Houses and Skyboxes: A house or skybox (sometimes both) is currently placed on the parcel, but it can be removed if you prefer a bare lot to start fresh. We also offer a variety of houses and skyboxes that can be placed on your parcel upon request.
Guidelines:

Please be mindful of neighbors and adhere to community standards.
Ensure that your objects do not exceed the prim allowance for your rental.
Any disruptive or harmful activities will be addressed and may result in termination of the rental agreement.
Payments and Renewals:

Rental payments are due weekly and can be made directly to the rental box located on your parcel.
To avoid any interruptions in your rental, please ensure payments are made on time. A reminder will be sent before the rental period expires.
Feedback and Support:
Your satisfaction is important to us! If you have any suggestions, concerns, or need support, please do not hesitate to reach out.
