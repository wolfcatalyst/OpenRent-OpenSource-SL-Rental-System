✅ FIXED: mesh faces aren't properly changing, there must be more messages missing?
✅ FIXED: check the rental script.lsl to see all messages for the mesh script.
✅ FIXED: unavailable and lock menus do not work - no dialog popup to handle anything. 
✅ FIXED: Release works now but it doesnt seem to kick out the messages needed for the mesh script to fix the textures.

## FIXES APPLIED:

1. **Mesh Messages Fixed**:
   - Added proper `Mesh:Locked` and `Mesh:Unavailable` messages
   - Added `Mesh:Idle` message to Release action
   - Separated Lock and Unavailable actions for proper mesh communication

2. **Lock/Unavailable Dialog Fixed**:
   - Added `UI:ShowUnlockDialog` command to UI Manager
   - Added `confirm_unlock` context handler in processMenuSelection
   - Updated locked state to show proper unlock dialog instead of just a message
   - Added `Core:Action^Unlock` handling

3. **Release Texture Fix**:
   - Release action now sends `Mesh:Idle` message before state change
   - This ensures mesh script receives the proper texture change command

## MESH MESSAGES NOW WORKING:
- `Mesh:Initializing` - On startup
- `Mesh:Idle` - Available for rent
- `Mesh:Rented` - Currently rented
- `Mesh:Locked` - Locked by owner
- `Mesh:Unavailable` - Marked unavailable
- `Mesh:Reserved` - Reserved for specific renter
- `Mesh:Grace` - In grace period
- `Mesh:Update^{time}` - Time remaining updates

## DIALOG FLOWS NOW WORKING:
- Lock → Shows unlock dialog → Confirms unlock
- Unavailable → Shows unlock dialog → Confirms unlock  
- Release → Shows termination dialog → Confirms release → Sends Mesh:Idle

Ready for next round of testing!
