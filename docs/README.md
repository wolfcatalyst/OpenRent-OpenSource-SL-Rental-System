You're on your own, champâ€”but good luck!

## Setup

For a complete list of what goes inside the in-world rental box, see [rental-box-contents.md](../rental-box-contents.md).

## ðŸ“¦ Models

Prebuilt mesh models are available in the [`models/`](../models) directory:

- `.dae` files are ready for upload to Second Life
- The included `.blend` file can be used for customization or reference

These meshes are optimized to function as **1-prim** solutions that normally require multiple linked prims in standard SL builds.
