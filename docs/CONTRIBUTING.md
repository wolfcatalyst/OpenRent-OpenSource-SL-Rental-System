Thank you for your interest in contributing to this open-source Second Life project!

This project welcomes contributions—but please read the following guidelines before submitting changes.

## Guidelines

1. **Respect the Vision**
   - This project is intentionally kept simple, modular, and end-user friendly.
   - Please avoid over-engineering, bloated features, or drastic design changes unless discussed in advance.

2. **Script Attribution**
   - Do not remove or obscure the original author's name (`Wolf Catalyst`) in scripts.
   - Add your own name as a contributor using a comment block or header tag if submitting changes.

3. **How to Submit Changes**
   - Fork the repo and create a new branch for your changes.
   - Submit a pull request with a clear description of what your code does and *why* it's useful.
   - Bonus points if you include an in-world test case or example.

4. **Code Style**
   - Follow LSL best practices and keep things commented.
   - Try to maintain compatibility with mono and memory-constrained environments.

5. **Approval Required**
   - All pull requests are subject to manual review.
   - Only approved changes will be merged to the main project. You’re welcome to maintain forks or alternative versions under the open-source license, but only accepted PRs will be included in the official release.

6. **Bug Reports & Suggestions**
   - Please use GitHub Issues for bug reports or feature ideas.
   - You can also reach out in-world to `Wolf Catalyst` with any feedback.
